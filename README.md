		○ Description:
			A quiz of learning in ascending order the Presidents of the United States utilizing tKinter.
		○ Technical Details:
			The main objective of this project is to use OOP and tKinter. The quiz would have a Menu, a game layout and a ending stats screen. 
			
            The data would be just like sample #5, Quiz Application, where the user can create a test simply by uploading a text file.
			
            Normal Mode- where the user goes through the game until the end and the results are displayed.
			
            I titled this game "A Presidential Dinner" as my uncle used to quiz the Presidents to me in ascending order at dinner time when I was a teenager. They are some of my favorite memories.
