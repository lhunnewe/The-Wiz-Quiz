Project Overview

Default questionnaire will be for all the Presidents to memorize them in ascending order using tKinter
○ Description:
	A quiz of learning in ascending order the Presidents of the United States utilizing tKinter.
○ Technical Details:
	The main objective of this project is to use OOP and tKinter. The quiz would have a Menu, a game layout and a ending stats screen. 
	
	The data would be just like sample #5, Quiz Application, where the user can create a test simply by uploading a text file.
	
	Normal Mode- where the user goes through the game until the end and the results are displayed.
	
	I titled this game "A Presidential Dinner" as my uncle used to quiz the Presidents to me in ascending order at dinner time when I was a teenager. They are some of my favorite memories.
